it begins with random snippets of code that may or may not currently do anything whatsoever;  basically i'm doing a bunch of things at the same time, kind of writing a math engine but it's also a book about perl6, and a translation of the golfed-version of the kerr black hole code you can find in another recent repository into a perl6 framework... none of this works yet, it might not actually run as a program for 6 more months, i'm basically just blocking-in values with code because perl6 is my favorite coding language to read!
